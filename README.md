# PingPong Ladder


Ladder System for Ping Pong. Just a quick webapp used by me and my friends to track whos the best at Ping Pong. 
The webapp uses a local MongoDB instance to store stats. The ladder ranking is based of the Glicko Rating Algorithm where your score is determined by the score of the opponents that you beat. 


## How to run
To Run this app you will need both MongoDB and Node.js

```

1. To run mongoDB just go to the mongo folder and type: mongod
2. Install the needed dependancies by navigating to the Ping Pong Folder and typing: npm install
3. Run the app by typing: Node server.js

```
