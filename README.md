# PingPongDoping


Ladder System for Ping Pong. Just a quick webapp used by me and my friends to track whos the best at Ping Pong. 
The webapp uses a local MongoDB instance to store stats. The ladder ranking is based of the Glicko Rating Algorithm where your score is determined by the score of the opponents that you beat. 


## How to run
To Run this app you will need both MongoDB and Node.js

```
1. Run MongoDB by going into the folder through command prompt and typing: Mongod
2. Run the app by going into the project folder and typing: Node server.js

```
